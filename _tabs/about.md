Hey there 👋! <br>
As you can see my name on the `left-bar`, but you can just call me "**Bayu**". I work full-time as a developer at **Sarana Pactindo Group**, a company that builds and delivers banking solutions. Alongside my professional work, I also run a side project called **MentalChat**, a community platform dedicated to supporting people with mental health challenges. It’s a space where technology and empathy meet, and it’s something I’m deeply passionate about.

## Why im creating this blog?
Honestly, I just wanted a space to share my journey—especially in the AI/ML and IT development world. I’m always learning new things, experimenting, and stumbling into cool stuff along the way. This blog is my way of putting those experiences out there,whether it’s lessons learned, thoughts worth sharing, or just little discoveries that might inspire someone else. Stay tune for my new post✌️
